# PlusTiC [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Landmaster/PlusTiC.svg?branch=1.12)](http://travis-ci.org/Landmaster/PlusTiC)
Minecraft mod for adding new tools to and integrating various mods with Tinkers Construct

CurseForge page: *Coming soon*
## New tool(s)
- Katana. A fast two-handed weapon that deals increasing damage the more mobs you kill.
- Laser Gun. A ranged weapon that requires durability and energy (Forge, Tesla, RF).
## A note about Natural Pledge
Starting in 5.1.2.0, PlusTiC forces out and *overrides* Natural Pledge TiC materials by default. This can be changed in the config so that PlusTiC does *not* add Botania materials if Natural Pledge is loaded.
